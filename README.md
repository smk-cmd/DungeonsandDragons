# DungeonsandDragons
This is a dungeon crawler game where the player must try to traverse and fight their way through the tower.


In a collaborative group setting of three individuals, a Java-based game titled "Dungeons and Dragons" was developed. The objective of the game was for the player to navigate and engage in combat within a tower environment. The gameplay entailed progressing through various maps, contending with legendary creatures, and successfully exiting each map. Each participant, including both mythical creatures and players, possessed distinct health bars and superpowers, which were utilized to defeat opponents and advance to subsequent maps, ultimately accomplishing victory in the game. The game's implementation was exclusively executed using the Java programming language.
